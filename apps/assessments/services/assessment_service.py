"""Assessment service for authorized, traceable student grading workflow.

This service keeps evaluation rules simple and explicit. It does not import any
Django request/response object; instead it validates authorization, visibility,
and auditability.

Relevant rules:
- BR-130: only authorized academic users may create or modify official assessments.
- BR-131: students may view only their own released assessments.
- BR-132: assessment creation/modification must be traceable.
- BR-133: assessment decisions should not automatically judge student character.
