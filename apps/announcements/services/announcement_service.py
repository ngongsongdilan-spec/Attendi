"""Announcement service for scoped academic announcements.

This service keeps announcements limited to the correct academic scope and
records important edits in a clear audit trail. It intentionally avoids Django
request/response objects and raises domain exceptions for API mapping.

Relevant rules:
- BR-080: faculty announcements are scoped to a faculty
- BR-081: department announcements are scoped to a department
- BR-082: course/class announcements are visible only to eligible users
- BR-083: only authorized users may create or publish announcements
- BR-084: important announcement edits must be auditable
