"""Course enrollment service.

This module implements the course-based enrollment rules for the FET Platform.
It deliberately avoids framework-specific web objects and raises domain errors
instead of returning HTTP responses.

Business rules enforced here:
- BR-010: Students enroll in courses; class attendance is not created by
  manually enrolling in every class/session.
- BR-011: Active course enrollment makes a student eligible for future classes.
- BR-012: A course roster is the source of default class eligibility.
- BR-013: New enrollments apply to future classes under that course.
- BR-014: Dropping a course ends future eligibility without deleting history.
- BR-015: Historical records must remain intact when enrollment changes.
