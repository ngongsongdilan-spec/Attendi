/**
 * Self-healing against a service worker pinned to an old build.
 *
 * This app has never shipped a service worker, but if any earlier deployment
 * on this origin ever registered one, it keeps answering navigations from its
 * own cache — and no HTTP cache header can get past that (a SW cache ignores
 * Cache-Control entirely, and a phone's "hard refresh" does not exist).
 * Clearing registrations and Cache Storage on boot costs nothing when there
 * is none, and unpins the device when there is.
