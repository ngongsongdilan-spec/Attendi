"""Audit trail helper for significant platform actions.

This helper is intentionally framework-agnostic and plain-Python so it can be
called by services without including any Django request or DRF response logic.
The goal is to keep all significant academic corrections and security-sensitive
actions traceable and non-silent.

Business rules enforced here:
- BR-042: attendance corrections retain an audit trail and never silently
  overwrite historical activity.
- BR-132: every significant assessment create/modify action is traceable.
- BR-210: important actions involving authentication, attendance, assessments,
  projects, permissions, and security settings must be audited.
